  * UML diagram: An class diagram, sequence diagram 
  * Documentation: This file introduce our project process and discribe how to play the game
  * nine java classes


Change's Log:

  Pengliang:
      1. Created a class called GUIFrame
      2. Added mapping panel and selection panel on the frame
      3. Added buttons on the selection panel.

  Bohua:

  Kevin:

Known Issues:
  1. Unable to execute Game.java directly, have to change all methods and ready to use by GUI
  2. Have to write new method which return all zombies and plants and can access their position
  3. Do not have use's input from console, all input have to implement by button click
  4. Number of suns have to changed to a small creating rate, too much suns was created.


Road Map:
  1. Pengliang will creat a class and wich named the class GUIFrame.java
  2. 


Work distribution: 
  Pengliang Zhang: Creat GUI frame class, which will creat method to add selection panel, mapping panel and menu bar
                   which will creat a method to update map for each turn
  Xinrui Li      : Working with the logic, Update game.java
  Bohua Cao      : Working with the test, test all class using JUnit test
  Kevin Li       : Working with documentations, UML, check the process of the project and make sure everyone finish all works on time
