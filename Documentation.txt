Design process
    For our group project 
        Firstly we talked about the game, and list all necessary function we need to acomplish. So, we think our the Plant VS Zombie should be able 
        to create new game. During the game process, users have to make decision whether they want to pass the creating plant step or they want to create
        a plant and put into the game map. Then, the game also need to create Zombies in random x position(x>=1 && x<=5) and from y=1(Y>=1 && Y<=10), so that
        we create the zombie and plant class, which will make those zombie and plant be object in the game class. then we talked about details about how many 
        suns are needed to create plants and how many times attacks will a demage plant kill a basic zombie. 
    
        Secondly, we dispatch all works to each team members, and everyone has to write there method and at the end, all works will be merged together.
