Design process
    For our group project 
        Firstly, we talked about how to improve our game to the full feature. We thought we need to add more zombie and plants types. We 
        decided to add an Advanced zombie and an Advanced Peashooter which has more health and damage to each other. Then, according to the 
        requirements, the game also need to include the unlimeted redo and undo features. So that, we thought we can use the same technique
        which we used on the lab 9. Finally we dispatch works to each group member.

        Secondly, after all team members finish their work, Beck merged everything together.
        
        
Milestone 3 Update
    In the Milestone 3, our game created more fectures and let user to have fun. First, we add more type of Peashooter and Zombie
    in the game, which will be difficult for user to win the game. To achieve the fectures, we added two classes to the projects
    which allow to create the object of advanced Peashooter and advanced zombie. Then, we added more method in game class to implements 
    the redo/undo logic. We also update all classes to implements Serialiable which can be usded in game class's method.
